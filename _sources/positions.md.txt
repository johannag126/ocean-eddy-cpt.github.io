# Positions

Multiple postdoctoral research positions are available as part of a
multi-institution Climate Process Team (CPT) on Ocean Transport and Eddy
Energy. The CPT aims to survey, improve, and unify new advances in energy-,
flow-, and scale-aware parameterizations of mesoscale eddies, in process
studies and global ocean models; constrain parameters and parameterized fluxes
through a synthesis of up-to-date observations of ocean energetics and
transport; and implement and assess schemes within IPCC-class climate models at
NCAR, NOAA-GFDL, and DOE-LANL. The expectation is that modernized,
energetically-consistent mesoscale eddy parameterizations will significantly
reduce climate model biases in ocean currents, stratification, and transport.

## Open positions

- The Department of Applied Mathematics at the University of Colorado, Boulder is seeking
a Postdoctoral Research Associate to work in the Climate Process Team (CPT) on
Ocean Transport and Eddy Energy. The role of the CU postdoc will be to develop and
implement new subgrid-scale parameterizations and to assess the accuracy of existing
parameterizations in the ocean component (MOM6) of CESM3 at non-eddying and 
eddy-permitting resolutions. The CU postdoc will be directly advised by Ian Grooms at CU,
and will work closely with members of NCAR's Ocean Section, as well as with the entire
CPT. The research will include mathematical modeling, diagnostic analysis of simulation
results, and running CESM3 simulations.
Minimum requirements include a Ph.D. in earth sciences, climate modeling, fluid dynamics,
applied mathematics, computational science, physics, or a closely related field.
For full consideration please apply by March 15, 2022. Applications must be submitted
through https://jobs.colorado.edu/jobs/JobDetail/?jobId=45509.
